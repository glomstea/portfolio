			<h1>Programming.</h1>
			<p>
			I have been studying programming since I was in the sixth grade when I taught myself how to create websites by coding in HTML. This interest grew into a foundation of other languages such as CSS and C++. Since then, I have coded several websites, games, and a variety of other programs. To the right you can see a screenshot of a database I made as part of my information technology management group project which tracked graduate student information with SQL and PHP.

			Here is some of the SQL that I created for our database which pulled information for our product.
